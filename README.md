# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# React Digital Marketing website example design

## Overview

The purpose of this website is to demonstrate:

1. React performance
2. Demonstrate website build
3. Working with a API on frontend
4. Storing and manipulating React state
5. Structuring an application with multiple components
6. HTML and CSS ability
7. Responsive web development ability
8. Intentionally made with React 18 + Vite

### Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Open the repository folder and install the dependencies using `yarn` or `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `yarn start` or `npm start`.

### How it works

Web apps may look simple but some functionality may require experience:

1. Retrieve the data from the mock API.
1. Output the data in a list, including properties from the data that are appropriate for a list view.
1. Implement a category filter - this can be single or multi-select.
1. Implement pagination - this can be traditional numbered pages or "load more".
1. Use semantic markup where possible.
1. Create a responsive layout with HTML and CSS.

### Advanced features

Some features may be added to boost performance as needed:

1. Use client-side routing to create a "detail" page using React-Router
1. Persist filter state in the query string using React Hooks
1. Include animated transitions between application state, e.g. when filtering.
1. Convert the application to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript.
1. Use a CSS preprocessor or CSS-in-JS rather than plain CSS.

## A typical project like this may take somewhere between 3-7 days
